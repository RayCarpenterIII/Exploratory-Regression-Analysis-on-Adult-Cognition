# Exploratory-Regression-Analysis-on-Adult-Cognition
We use different regression models to measure what variables affect adult cognition. The Rand Health and Retirement Study used was conducted from 1992 to 2020 and followed individuals nearing and after retirement. This project was carried out by Ray Carpenter and Jason Jiminez for Econ 550 - Health Econometrics. This repository contains the code to bring the data from the Rand HRS Longitudinal Dataset, to cleaning, and to produce the findings in the paper.
